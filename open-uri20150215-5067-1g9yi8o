	<h3>Lesley University gets Ringing Results from Enterprise Cloud Technology</h3>
<p>University help desks field a wide range of questions from students, professors, and parents, but most callers are unaware of the challenges in providing those answers. A high turnover rate or a lack of knowledgeable representatives, for example, can create obstacles. Faced with complaints about its IT help desk, Lesley University sought to improve the caller experience.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.1to1media.com/view.aspx?docid=35217" title="Lesley University gets Ringing Results from Enterprise Cloud Technology" target="_blank"></a></p>
<p>In 2013, Cooper developed an in-house solution with Freshdesk, a cloud-based help desk software maker. Instead of working with outsourced agents, the university hired students as part-time employees. About a dozen students were hired to provide IT support from four work stations.</p>

	<h3>Brands Don’t Pay Attention to Customers on #Twitter, Says Study</h3>
<p>An analysis of 100 of the world’s top consumer brands has found that those using Twitter respond to just one in five tweets from followers, including messages asking for help or support.</p>
<p>Using Interbrand’s 2014 list of top brands, Freshdesk looked at the companies’ Twitter response times between December 15th and December 22nd of last year – the pre-Christmas period – and found that brands responded to just 22 percent of tweets directed at their primary Twitter handles.</p>

	<h3>3 Steps for Scaling Customer Service for Small Business</h3>
<p>At Dreamforce this year, Freshdesk conducted an on-site survey focused on customer support experiences in a number of industries. The survey, completed by more than 350 marketing, IT, and customer support professionals, revealed some surprising results. Three out of four professionals, for example, said they have personally cut ties with a company due to poor customer service. On the other hand, survey findings showed that happy encounters with an organization's customer support heroes can change consumers' impressions of a company's brand for the better. The results are clear: The quality of a company's customer service has a tangible business impact, for better and for worse.</p>

Here are some strategies to use to deal with the avalanche of emails and calls at the end of the year.</p>

<p>Freshdesk announced a series of new features to provide greater power and flexibility for businesses with remote and geographically diverse customer support teams.</p>
<p>With this release, Freshfone is available as part of Freshdesk’s mobile apps on iOS and Android, so agents can answer calls and support their customers from anywhere, even when they’re on the go. Agents do not incur any call forwarding charges - they can simply start answering customers as long as they’re connected and online. With more businesses increasingly hiring remote agents to support local customers, the Freshdesk app enables companies to get these reps on board and supporting customers instantly from their mobile phones, wherever they are.</p>

<p>Close to 300 employees work for Freshdesk, and most of our work life is online. This would have been nearly impossible a few years ago, but it’s sort of the norm today for a business like us.

	<h3>4 ways to break the language barrier in global customer support</h3>
<p>No matter what you’re selling, it’s becoming increasingly common for your product or service to have a customer base that is spread across the world and speaks multiple languages. Even if you have phenomenal customer support reps and you invest heavily in support, your customers may not be getting what they need if your agents don’t speak your customers’ language. Here are ways to go the extra mile and ensure your support options are accessible to customers no matter where they are or what language they speak.</p>

	<h3>Right-Sizing the Twitter Support Strategy for a Business</h3>
<p>When a company is small, having a single touch point is definitely enough. But as the business grows, this is inefficient. The queries for support intermingle with branding efforts and customers might misinterpret marketing messages as callous indifference to their problems. So when a company expands into offering multiple products and reaching global markets, an entirely different strategy is needed to respond to customers on Twitter.</p>

	<h4>Freshdesk Raises $31 Million for Customer Support Software</h4>
<p>Big investors are betting that a young rival, Freshdesk, whose software helps companies with customer support, can grow into a dominant firm in its own right.</p>
<p>Freshdesk is expected to announce on Thursday that it has raised $31 million from three investment firms including Google Capital, which manages money for the software giant. The financing round is being led by Tiger Global Management, which is returning after investing earlier, and includes the venture capital firm Accel Partners, also a repeat investor.</p>

<p>The pre-emptive round, which included participation from new investor Google Capital and existing one Accel Partners , came together quickly and with little hassle due largely to the favorable terms and venerable track records of each firm, Freshdesk Founder and Chief Executive Girish Mathrubootham said.</p>

	<h4>Freshdesk CEO: We Raised $31 Million From Tiger And Google Capital Because Valuations Are About To Drop</h4>
<p>What's most interesting about the deal is that Mathrubootham says Freshdesk raised faster than it’d planned–the company had expected to raise again in December–because of the shifts in the market.</p>
<p>“The public market’s turning, and if we waited, we may have increased revenue without getting our desired valuation,” the CEO says. Freshdesk raised this new round while still retaining most of its money from its last September raise still in the bank, buoyed by a generous multiple and the fact that investors weren’t asking for an aggressive ownership stake. ”When you get the healthy multiple, you take the money,” Mathrubootham says.</p>

	<h4>Freshdesk becomes first Indian startup to get Google Capital backing with $31M Series D Funding</h4>
<p>Helpdesk software company Freshdesk – an Indian startup that quickly scaled up to rub shoulders with the global leaders in its domain – has raised US$31 million in a series D round of funding led by Tiger Global, which brings its total investment to US$44 million. Of particular interest is the participation of Google Capital – one of the two VC arms of the search giant. This makes Freshdesk the first Indian company to get backing from Google Capital, which has only five other companies in its portfolio. Accel Partners also participated in this round.</p>

<p>G2 Crowd, a crowdsourced business software review site, asked about 350 software buyers what help-desk services were the best, which features were most-used, and what didn’t work well. And Zendesk, Desk, and Freshdesk were the highest-rated services, winning “Leader” labels. </p>
<p>G2 Crowd’s data also shows which services get compared and contrasted most frequently. Freshdesk appears to be a top-compared solution, as it is one of the top three most-common comparisons on G2 Crowd’s site. The top comparison is Freshdesk versus Zendesk, followed by Zendesk versus Freshdesk, followed by Freshdesk versus TeamSupport, which was rated a Top Performer but not a Leader.</p>

	<h4>Three Reasons Why Every CEO Should Do Their Own Customer Support</h4>
<p>Thirteen years ago, I started my career as a pre-sales engineer offering support to complex tech projects. A few years later, I became a Product Manager and directly oversaw the customer support and pre-sales teams for several years before deciding to launch Freshdesk.</p>
<p>Today, as CEO of Freshdesk, I often jump on our helpdesk to respond to questions, and I sometimes get on calls with our users to help them with issues. Our business is helping brands deliver great support, and we try to do a good job at it ourselves. In fact, being consistently involved in our own support process has helped us improve quality standards and identify opportunities that add value to our core business.</p>

	<h4>Girish: CEOs Doing Time on the Support Desk</h4>
<p>As small business owners build their businesses up, add new people and take on more responsibilities, it’s easy to become disconnected from the very folks spurring that growth – their customers. But customer needs and expectations change over time which makes it critically important for the CEO of a growing company to find ways to stay in tune with the voice of the customer.</p>
<p>Girish Mathrubootham, CEO and founder of online customer support platform Freshdesk, came up with the idea of having CEOs dedicate some of their time playing the role of a customer support agent in order to help them stay within ear shot of what’s on the mind of their customers. He discusses what he calls CEO on Support, and the impact it can have on customer relationships.</p>

	<h4>Freshdesk Helps Pacific Northwest Newspapers Write a Circulation Success Story</h4>
<p>Two of the best known principles of journalism are getting the scoop on a hot item ahead of the competition and then staying on top of breaking developments. Following this proven formula has enabled Phil Schroder, Vice President of Audience Development for Washington state-based newspapers the News Tribune and The Olympian, to achieve impressive growth in the face of an ongoing downturn in the publishing industry.</p>
<p>His research led him to become an early adaptor of customer support software from insurgent SaaS provider Freshdesk while at another publisher. He then made it one of his first moves to implement the evolving solution and take advantage of its growing range of capabilities when he moved to the Pacific Northwest in early 2013.</p>

	<h3>8 Fresh Customer Service Ideas Worth Stealing</h3>
<p>Our ability to complain is enhanced by technical advances in communication. Tools like 4G networks, Google Glass, and phones that double as cameras ensure we have a continuous stream of ever more effective ways to complain.</p>
<p>But, even today, customer service still is considered to be “revolutionary” and “proactive” if you just respond to customers on Twitter or Facebook. In all seriousness, when was the last time we were wowed when Verizon or British Airways responded to us on Twitter?</p>
<p>If you want to make your customers happy, there are tactics you can use, from handwritten notes to custom-made YouTube videos. Here are some ideas you can steal from companies that truly are experts in the field.</p>

	<h4>How Gamification Makes Customer Service Fun</h4>
<p>Think about your last online or over-the-phone customer service experience. You're probably cringing. The scripted chat messages, fruitless attempts to circumvent the dreaded "Press 3 to connect to Billing" phone tree system. This traditional customer service experience is process-oriented, tedious, and it leaves customers frustrated and dissatisfied, says Girish Mathrubootham, founder and CEO, Freshdesk.</p>
<p>But the paradigm is shifting, as companies like Freshdesk incorporate gamification to help drive happier, more satisfied employees and, most importantly, customers, he says.</p>

	<h3>10 Powerful, Cloud-Based Helpdesk Services To Help You Win at Customer Service</h3>
<p>Help desk software has changed a lot over the years. It’s gotten prettier, for starters, and it’s more accessible. But the changes go beyond features: many companies are realizing that when customers want to vent, they’re going to do it in public. As a result, help desk software is increasingly multichannel, making flagging — and responding to — Twitter mentions and Facebook posts just as important as fielding direct support emails or phone calls. Here are a few of the newer, more nimble help desk companies out here.</p>
<p>Freshdesk’s help desk offers many of the features companies have come to expect. These features include team-wide support inboxes, automated ticket dispatching, social customer support, and community forums. Freshdesk also offers built-in ticket time-tracking, which it says helps find bottlenecks in the support process.</p>

	<h3>The report of my death was an exaggeration, Freshdesk tells Forbes &amp; Microsoft</h3>
<p>Cash-rich companies like Microsoft have an easy way to get new ideas and talent: acquire smaller, more innovative companies. But when a big company acquires a startup, what happens to other startups in the space? According to an article in Forbes, that’s the end of competition in that domain, and the other small players might as well shut shop.</p>
<p>Such a tall claim made in an international US-based business publication may have normally gone unchallenged, and misled readers around the world, not to mention clients of all the companies concerned. Freshdesk's CEO Girish Mathrubootham has made it clear that the game was far from being up.</p>

	<h3>'Dumb' Customer Questions: Are They Your Fault?</h3>
<p>So, this elderly and exhausted woman calls in to a tech support line. She goes on and on about how she just bought a new PC and the “cup holder” in it broke when she placed her coffee. The support rep begins apologizing without even knowing what he was apologizing for, and she demands a replacement immediately. A few questions later, the puzzled support agent finally realizes the “cup holder” is the DVD tray!</p>
<p>Heard similar “dumb” questions before? Customer Support Representatives (when they had finally stopped laughing at the questions) call these questions “User Errors” or “ID10T errors.” But, look at the situation this way: If you built something for your customers, and they can’t even get started with it, where do you think the problem lies? </p>

	<h3>The Customer Support Hierarchy of Needs</h3>
<p>If you looked at how different organizations handled their customer support, the maturity of their operations, and the problems they were trying to solve, companies fall into 4 distinct strata — from a state of chaos, all the way up to the point where their support is perfectly aligned with their business goals. And as you move up the chain towards alignment, the number of companies in each strata steadily falls. I call this the Great Pyramid of Support Needs.</p>

	<h4>With 10,000 customers, Freshdesk continues the battle with Zendesk</h4>
<p>The online customer service software platform war wages on. In one corner, we have the large and well-established Zendesk. In the other, the two-year-old up-and-comer upstart, Freshdesk. And, of course, in a third corner we have a slew of other contenders like Uservoice, h2desk, TenderApp, Desk.com, CharmHQ, to just name a few.</p>
<p>But let’s take the two biggest, the Hertz and Avis of customer service platform companies. Like Avis, Freshdesk implies that it tries harder, and just announced that it has reached 10,000 customers. Given that the company launched its product in mid-2011, this shows steady improvement.</p>

	<h4>India’s hottest tech products</h4>
<p>At the core of Freshdesk’s customer support software—which it sells as a service at between $16 and $40 a month for each customer service agent—is a simple premise: happy customer support executives make for happy customers.</p>
<p>That’s easier said than done. Customer support is one of those repetitive, mind-numbing tasks, albeit one that is critical to a company’s success, especially in the age of social media when an unhappy customer can amplify his or her angst on Twitter or Facebook.</p>

<p>We hear much about customer centricity. Yet when you look behind the words, it is often isolated to front line customer support and customer facing groups.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is applied to a few “tiers” beyond that. Yet true customer centricity is a culture and practice where everyone’s job is customer support! For this post, I asked Vikram Bhaskaran, Director of Marketing for customer support solution provider, Freshdesk, to tell me what is happening there.</p>

<p>Freshdesk, the customer support solution company, has released its report on the ‘State of Consumer Support’ which offers interesting insights and analysis as to where customer support is heading to, and how the field might evolve in the near future(or shall we say already evolving) thanks to digital media and social networking platforms like Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>The study, based on findings from responses of more than 2,50,000 customers, has thrown light on how businesses adapt to new age digital mediums for providing customer support and experience to their end users and how far the customers of these companies are satisfied from the interaction with the support staff on social media and chat mediums.</p>

	<h4>Freshdesk Report Confirms that Customers Are Increasingly Adopting Social Media in lieu of Phone and Email for Lodging Complaints</h4>
<p>Freshdesk, one of the best known startup success stories to emerge from India, has published a State of Customer Support report based on the data gleaned from the 250,000 users of its customer support software.</p>
<p>The key takeaways are not very surprising. Customers hate being put on hold, and are the happiest when their queries are resolved within a reasonable amount of time following which satisfaction ratings plummet. In most cases, customers expect their queries to be resolved within a day. However, resolution time isn’t the sole parameter that determines customer satisfaction. Transparent and effective communication is also of paramount importance.</p>

	<h4>Delighting Customers</h4>
<p>Ideas can come from anywhere. Sometimes it could be staring you right in the face for years and you may not see it. Luckily for Girish Mathrubootham, his eureka moment happened by accident. In mid-2010, the techie was browsing through Hacker News, a web community for geeks, where he read that online customer support company Zendesk had increased its rates by 60-300%, leaving its customers very unhappy.</p>
<p>One irate customer had remarked that there was a huge opening in the market for someone with a product at the right price. “It was like a slap on my face for not seeing the business opportunity in customer support, especially since I had been building on-premise helpdesk systems since 2004 at Zoho,” recalls 37-year-old Mathrubootham, who was a vice-president at the Chennai-based customer relationship management (CRM) software company at the time.</p>

<p>This is the story of how a simple comment online (Hacker News, Zendesk’s pricing policy) on expensive and poor quality helpdesk services inspired a man to launch something in an effort to provide better services at a low cost.</p>
<p>In his role as VP of product management at Zoho Corporation for several years, Girish Mathrubhootham built several successful products in the IT management domain. He has over 13 years of experience in making and marketing IT management products. At Zoho Mathrubhootham realised there weren’t many customer service providers.

	<h4>Freshdesk's new MobiHelp SDK enables direct customer support for iOS apps</h4>
<p>One of the key complaints from iOS developers is they can't directly respond to feedback from their users.<br />Instead, this situation typically ends in one star iTunes reviews, even when the issue could be easily resolved - a developer's worst nightmare.</p>
<p>Presumably Apple will get around to an official solution at some point, but in the meantime, cloud-based US/Indian customer support outfit Freshdesk is rolling out its version.</p>

	<h4>Freshdesk Releases HTML5 Mobile Site for Customer Support</h4>
<p>Freshdesk officials today rolled out a mobile site version of the company’s flagship online customer support software.</p>
<h5>On the Go Customer Help, Regardless of Device</h5>
<p>The offering — dubbed FreshMobile — enables users worldwide to resolve tickets, manage email templates and respond to customer queries from an interface catered to tablets and smartphones. Unlike native mobile applications, Freshdesk developers used HTML5 coding to optimize navigation regardless of the device type or operating system.</p>
<p>FreshMobile integrates features that streamline the mobile work experience in several ways. Intelligent algorithms, for example, serve up suggested resolutions from the knowledge base using keywords in the customer ticket. This saves the agent from re-typing search terms in the knowledge base. Once the correct resolution is selected, FreshMobile immediately provides the corresponding preset response.</p>

<p>Customer support has been evolving and embracing social technologies to better connect with customers. Some companies are embracing social and integrating social streams into the CRM process.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, when customers submit support queries, support agents should be able to see which sales person closed the deal and who is currently working with them. This would give support teams more information and insight to prioritize issues and determine the amount of attention needed for each request.</p>

<p>For Freshdesk had raised Series A funding of $1 million from Accel Partners only a few months ago, which was also hotly bid by three or four venture capital firms.

	<h4>Freshdesk Launches $10M “Future Fund” To Bring Free Help Desk Support To 500+ Startups</h4>
<p>Freshdesk is trying to make waves in cloud customer support. Launched in June of last year, the young company is on a mission to help businesses of all sizes manage customer service through both traditional channels, like email and phone, as well on social networks like Facebook and Twitter. Earlier this week, Freshdesk added to its customer support suite, launching support for private customer messages via the new Brand Pages Facebook launched back in February. This means that, using the new Pages, customers can initiate private conversations with brands, with the ability to share the kind of sensitive information they wouldn’t post publicly on Facebook or Twitter, like passwords and credit card numbers.</p>
<p>Freshdesk said that it’s the first customer support platform to offer this kind of integration, a shot across the bow of its two largest and well-established competitors, Zendesk and Salesforce’s Desk.com. To compete, the startup is making a push to differentiate its platform, adding private messaging via Brand Pages on top of what it believes is its core differentiator: Allowing its customers to support and manage multiple products and brands from one simple web interface.</p>

Started in 2010, the SaaS customer support tool launched to the public in June 2011, and raised $1 million in funding from Accel Partners in October 2011. They have tripled their customer base in the last quarter, though didn’t comment on how many customers they have to date.</p>
<p>Freshdesk founder Girish Mathrubootham said this is Tiger Global’s first investment in the SaaS space, as they have typically focused on investments in ecommerce companies including Warby Parker and One King’s Lane. “Obviously they see a lot of value in what we are doing in terms of social customer support,” he said in an interview. “Most of these ecommerce companies realize the importance of not just traditional customer support through email or phone, but also the capability to do social customer support. What we are doing is combining the aspects of a traditional support solution and the social aspects.”</p>

	<h4>Freshdesk Announces Integration with Popular Bug Tracking Tool, JIRA 5; Marries Customer Support and Engineering</h4>
<p>Freshdesk, the cloud-based social help desk software provider, has announced an integration with the latest version of Atlassian’s popular bug and issue tracking tool, JIRA 5.</p>
<p>The new integration brings the software engineering team even closer to the end customer. Support agents can directly link bugs reported by customers to existing issues in JIRA, or even create a new issue from within Freshdesk. Through this integration, Freshdesk automatically maps status updates and bug-related data in JIRA to the corresponding tickets raised by customers in the help desk.</p>
<p>“JIRA helps software development teams provide their end-users with high-quality software, while Freshdesk allows them to continue the relationship through exceptional customer support,” says Girish Mathrubootham, CEO of Freshdesk. “With the new integration, engineering teams will be able to identify the bugs that most customers want to be fixed first, and prioritize their projects and tasks accordingly.”</p>

	<h4>Accel-Backed Freshdesk Wants To Take On Zendesk With Customer Support Platform</h4>
<p>Freshdesk, which has raised $1 million in funding from Accel Partners, is debuting a new version of its cloud-based customer support platform today. Similar to the leader in the space, Zendesk, the India-based startup aims to bring customer service to the cloud by offering a simple, online help desk and support ticketing application.</p>
<p>With the new version of Freshdesk, customer service agents can support, update and assign projects directly from an email client, without needing to log in or use a mobile app. Agents simply email or forward a request to a Freshdesk unique email address and the request will be added to Freshdesk’s interface. Freshdesk automatically processes the command, makes the update, and sends the rest of the email to the appropriate customer. Agents can also directly send an email to a specific address, automatically converting the ticket to a knowledge base article that can be accessed by any agent.</p>

	<h4>Freshdesk Takes Customer Support Social, Raises $1 Million from Accel Partners</h4>
<p>SaaS-based, social customer support startup Freshdesk today announced that it has secured US $1 Million in funding from global venture capital firm Accel Partners. The investment will be used to expand the product team and step up marketing and business development efforts.</p>
<p>“The future of customer support is on the cloud, and a good portion of it will happen on the company’s Facebook and Twitter pages. Freshdesk also places particular emphasis on ease of use and intuitiveness, with the view that any company should be able to get it up and running in a few minutes.” says Girish Mathrubootham, CEO of Freshdesk.</p>
<p>Freshdesk was founded in 2010 by former Zoho executives, Girish Mathrubootham and Shanmugam Krishnasamy. In March this year, a chance listing on AngelList drew enormous investor interest, which led to the Series A funding. As part of the investment, Shekhar Kirani from Accel Partners will now be joining Freshdesk’s board of directors. The Series A Funding comes just as Freshdesk released a host of new features, including Facebook and Twitter integration, enabling businesses to take complete control of their customer service over social media.</p>

	<h4>The Cloud Of Opportunities</h4>
<p>Circa 2010. Chennai-based Girish Mathrubootham was getting restless in his job as a marketing executive in Zoho Corp. The Internet was evolving rapidly. He was fidgeting around for the right business on the Internet, but that Eureka moment was evading him. Until, he was convinced that he could quit to make a living out of the ‘cloud’. Mathrubootham’s moment arrived when he had an epiphany in a business meeting in Chennai in early 2011. That led to the creation of Freshdesk, a firm that enables sales teams and brand managers to reach out to customers who voice their problems against a firm on social media such as Facebook. “With social networks becoming a powerful tool to reach out to customers, it was only natural that even help desks moved to the cloud,” says Mathrubootham.</p>
<p>As opposed to the Internet, with which it is often mistaken, cloud computing (or grid computing) refers to the capability of delivering computing as a service — using an inter-connected grid of computers — to a host of users who pay for the service as per use. What is offered could be basic computing or storage, software or data.</p>

	<h4>The 1M/1M Incubation Radar: Freshdesk, Chennai, India</h4>
<p>A finalist in the Microsoft BizSpark India Startup Challenge, Freshdesk is a SaaS company that provides small and medium businesses with on-demand customer support software that offers multi-channel social support. Freshdesk introduces itself as a kind of Salesforce.com for customer support so to speak. Small- and medium-business owners can set up online customer support platforms that combine the backend help desk system used by agents (ticketing, knowledge management) with an online customer portal (self service, forums, idea management, voting, etc) on the front end.</p>
<p>Freshdesk was founded in 2010 by CEO, Girish Mathrubootham and CTO, Shan Krishnasamy. Before starting Freshdesk, Mathrubootham worked as a vice-president of product management and Krishnasamy as a technical architect for the Manage Engine division of Zoho Corporation. Mathrubootham successfully built products such as the Manage Engine Service Desk Plus, an ITIL service desk software used for internal IT support. It generated millions of dollars in revenues in 2010. Mathrubootham, with help from Krishnasamy, also built Op Manager, a network monitoring software that also generated several million dollars in revenues in 2010. Krishnasamy wrote the 1.0 version of the Manage Engine Netflow Analyzer, which is now a multi-million dollar product.</p>

	<h4>Strategy Roundtable For Entrepreneurs: 1M/1M Announces Partnership With TiE Chennai</h4>
<p>First up, Girish Mathrubootham from Chennai, India, presented Freshdesk, a SaaS solution for multi-channel customer support including knowledge base and social CRM support. Girish and his team are former Zoho employees and bring to their entrepreneurial efforts the perspective and learnings of Zoho, which has been successful in drastically undercutting high-end competitors in a major market, namely CRM, the office suite, and so on.</p>
<p>I liked this venture very much and see the basic framework of using the Indian cost structure to provide SaaS products that are competitive in terms of performance and functionality at drastically lower prices as a massive opportunity for Indian entrepreneurs to go after. Almost a thousand SaaS/cloud startups have been launched over the past decade, and in each niche there are opportunities for concept arbitrage using this basic formula.</p>
